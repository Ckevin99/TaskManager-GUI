3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
The minimum requirements are to have one screen and be interactive with users.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.


1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
developer.android.com/
youtube.com
bing copilot

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I will first understand the structures of the data and try to use input and  return a output using a button. I take kotlin in the last sprint, so I understand it a little.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
I will use my last project but instead I will make a gui application withe a similiar logic. as a stretch challenge I will do a two screen app.
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I just have one week to finish it. So I will work 90 minutes every day at night on this module.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

Last week, I had a problem with serialization. I wasted many hours on it, but I planned to do it in only 10 minutes. So, first, I will check if I can make it to work. If I get some problems, I will try to adapt the software or ask for help on the topic that I am having difficulty with.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.
